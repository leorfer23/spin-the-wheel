# Production Fixes Required

## Critical Issues to Fix Before Production

### 1. ‚úÖ COUPONS NOT WORKING IN PRODUCTION - FIXED

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Coupons API was returning 404 in production due to Vercel not recognizing catch-all route.

**Root Cause:**

- Vercel doesn't properly recognize `api/tiendanube/proxy/[...path].js` catch-all route
- Works locally but fails in production with 404

**Solution Implemented:**

1. Created alternative endpoint `api/tiendanube-proxy.js` that uses query params
2. Updated `tiendaNubeApiService.ts` to use alternative endpoint in production
3. Added comprehensive logging to debug API requests

**Changes Made:**

- **NEW:** `api/tiendanube-proxy.js` - Alternative proxy endpoint using query params
- **UPDATED:** `src/services/integrations/tiendanube/tiendaNubeApiService.ts`:
  - Lines 69-72: Detects production and uses alternative endpoint
  - Lines 75-83: Enhanced production debugging logs
  - Lines 104-119: Better error logging for 404 responses

**How it Works Now:**

```javascript
// In development (localhost):
/api/tiendanube/proxy/6545032/coupons

// In production (rooleta.com):
/api/tiendanube-proxy?path=6545032/coupons
```

**Testing Required:**

- Deploy to production and verify coupons load correctly
- Check console logs for proper API routing
- Test coupon creation and assignment to wheel segments
